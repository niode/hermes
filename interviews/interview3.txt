Is it easy to distinguish between elements of the interface?
	Yes, but I would like to see command suggestions. I would add a splash screen when it loads up.

Is it satisfying to interact with the system?
	Yes, and I don't feel like any new widgets need to be added. I like that I have to use my imagination.

Sample interaction:
>look around
You see a rock and a door.

>run to rock
You go to the rock, and see something shiny on top of it.

>climb rock
You find a key on top of the rock.

>pick up key
You pocket the key.

>eat key
You die. Restart?
