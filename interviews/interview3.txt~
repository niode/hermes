Is it easy to distinguish between elements of the interface?
	Yes, but I would like to see command suggestions. I would add a splash screen when it loads up.

Is it satisfying to interact with the system?
	Yes, and I don't feel like any new widgets need to be added. I like that I have to use my imagination.
