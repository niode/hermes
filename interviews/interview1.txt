>jump
You jump.

>map
You have no item that can do that.

>look
You can see:
[1] A large rock (nearby)
[2] A large rock (1 hour) // The user could understand that this was the time
                          // it would take to reach the item.

>walk to rock
Which rock?

>[1]                      // The user typed "[1]" instead of "1".
You are at the large rock.

required, since users get frustrated that they don't know what they can do.
