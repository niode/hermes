Is it easy to distinguish between elements of the interface?
  Yes, however I would like to see more widgets to show thing like the current
  location of my character, and the currently equipped items on my character.

Is it satisfying to interact with the system?
	Yes, but it would be more satisfying with more widgets as I suggested.

Sample interaction:
>look around nearby
You see a nearby treasure chest. It is locked.

>look for key
You found a shiny key.

>open chest
The chest opens. You find inside a sword, a map, and some gold.

>equip sword
You are now holding the sword.
