documentation on command syntax.

# Game Mechanics
Story
--
As a player I pick up an item and I can store it in an inventory for later use.
I may also drop unwanted items.

# Object Generation
Story
--
As a player I can use an item to interact with other items in ways that make
sense within the world of the game, but that are novel and surprising.

Story
--
As a player I have a 'modular character', in the sense that my abilities are
determined by the items I have access to. E.g. my character can obtain improved
legs to increase its running speed, and a character without legs can't move.

# World Generation
Story
--
As a player I begin a new game and the world is new (has not been seen in any
previous games).

Story
--
As a player I can observe an object in the world and I will see its 'history',
i.e. its past interactions with other objects in the world, provided my
character has the appropriate tools.
