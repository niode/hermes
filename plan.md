Story
--
I type a command into the game which is not understood, and I get an informative
message suggesting valid commands.

Story
--
I can type commands in English without having to refer to documentation on
command syntax.

Story
--
I begin a new game and the world is new (has not been seen in any previous
games).

Story
--
I pick up an item and I can store it in an inventory for later use. I may also
drop unwanted items.

Story
--
I have an interface that provides basic information about my character, such as
the contents of my 'inventory'.

Story
--
I can use an item to interact with other items in ways that make sense within
the world of the game, but that are novel and surprising.

Story
--
I have a 'modular character', in the sense that my abilities are determined by
the items I have access to. E.g. my character can obtain improved legs to
increase its running speed, and a character without legs can't move.

Story
--
I can request descriptions of an item's properties and they will be provided in
English.

Story
--
I can observe an object in the world and I will see its 'history', i.e. its past
interactions with other objects in the world, provided my character has the
appropriate tools.

Story
--
I can view a log that describes my own own history, provided I have the
appropriate tools.
