Text-based adventure game concept

#Features:#

-random environments and occurances based on random algorithms

Bonus Features (time permitting):

-simple 8-bit graphics

#Competition:#
-Not too many of these games are currently being made. A number of them existed in the past though. One example: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-game-30th-anniversary-edition



-None of these games would update until the player took actions. To enhance immersion, we may add elements that would be timer based, and require the player to take actions at a specific time interval. This would be represented in game as a new line being printed represednting the new game state.
