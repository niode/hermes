With a burst of electricity, you awaken.
You are a robot.
You know this becuase you hava an identifySelf(); function.
You are modular. You have four slots to equip various items. Some would mistake these as two "arm" slots and two "leg" slots, but you know better. You could equip anything to these slots.

You are alone in a dark place. Fortunately, you currently have a flash light equipped in one slot.
